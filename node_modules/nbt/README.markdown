NBT.js
======

by Sijmen Mulder.

NBT.js is a JavaScript parser for uncompressed [NBT](http://www.minecraft.net/docs/NBT.txt) archives, for use with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Usage
-----

After `var nbt = require('nbt')`, you can use `nbt.parse(data)` to convert uncompressed NBT data into a regular JavaScript object.

    var fs = require('fs'),
    	nbt = require('nbt');
    
    fs.readFile('bigtest.nbt', function(error, data) {
    	if (error) throw error;
    	
    	var result = nbt.parse(data);
    	console.log(result.Level.stringTest);
    	console.log(result.Level['nested compound test']);
    });

Tag names are copied verbatim, and as some names are not valid JavaScript names, use of the indexer may be required â€“ such as with the nested compound test in the example above.

Byte arrays are returned as Node.js `Buffer` objects.

Known issues
------------

 * No formal test cases (only a sample program)
 * 64 bit integers overflow
